# Unocded

Since 2015, Uncoded has fostered community spirit among technology professionals and enthusiasts in Long Beach, CA. We host regular social events at which attendees can form new contacts, receive advice on job-hunting, and geek out on everything from open-source software to hydroponics to 3D printing.

## Mission

To create and inspire a passionate, sharing, and inventive local tech culture through open, inclusive engagement with our community.

## Vision

We imagine a city where community life goes hand-in-hand with technology, and where people freely share ideas and software

This the the official Hugo site Repo for the [Uncoded Website](https://uncoded.org/).
